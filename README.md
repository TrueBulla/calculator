This project was created for The Odin Project.

In this project, I practiced EventListener manipulation and problem solving. The biggest challenge I faced while solving this was trying to think through the logic of each scenario and then implementing it to function as intended. I feel that this helped me practice breaking down functionality into smaller parts and then blending all the smaller pieces into one larger piece.
